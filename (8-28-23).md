I continued to follow along with the top down tutorial I found, but a few of the things I tried that it told me to do wouldn't work. This time, it showed me how to use the animation tree and the animation player, but when I put the animations from the animaiton tree into the animation player, the animations wouldn't work correctly. I tried setting up the animation tree different ways, connecting the boxes with the different sets of animations in different orders, and looking up different ways that you could do it. None of them worked so I tried to set up the animations themselves differently. We then had the meeting about the daily logs, and I started making different logs for everyday that I hadn't yet.
