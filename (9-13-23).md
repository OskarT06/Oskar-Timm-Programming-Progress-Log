I started by going back to the shadow enemy and trying to fix the chasing. Luckily, Hiro put in his chase code that worked, though I do have to adjust it a little bit because the enemy is too fast, and it still doesn't wonder or play the animations. The code that is now in the temporary scene that I made doesn't work, and for some reason, the enemy only "chases" the player if you walk into the shadow enemies feet and get the two hitboxes stuck together. Zack finished making the 7th enemy for our game so I animated that. Luckily, if I can figure out how to code it so that the shadow enemy wanders around, I'll be able to copy and paste the script onto the other enemies to make them wander as well.
