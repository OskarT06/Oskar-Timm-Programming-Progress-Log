I wetn to adjust the collision shape for the door and add an are2d so that the door can play the animations when the player walks up to the door and can walk through it. Hiro came over and asked if I can get to a stopping point so we can all push to main and start organizing files into there proper places and renaming them to all be in the same case. I don't want to start making anything new ot make sure there isn't anything in progress when Hiro wants us all to push to main. Once Zack was ready, we started merging all of our branches into the main branch. I closed godot since Hiro said oyu should always close godot if pulling changes from other branches. Once we finished merging into core, I merged core back into the base building branch so that I am perfectly up to date. Hiro is now going to start renaming and organizing files, but he is working in core branch so I am going to have to merge after he finishes doing that as well. Hiro told us to wait until he's done naming the files so we ccan merge from the core branch to have the files named the same and organized correctly.
