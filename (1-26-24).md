I have to figure out what to do next. I'm not sure if Zack wants me to continue working on the building system and add some new feature to it, or if he wants me to focus on something else now. I asked Zack once he got here, and he said that he wants me to contiue adding things to the building system, specifically larger objects such as walls. I started by just making it so that the shrine and the wall can both be in the same scene and both be placed. I couldn't figure out how to make both the shrine and the wall work at the same time, since they would either both not work, or both work exactly the same, neither of which I wanted. Zack came over and added a couple node2ds, made the shrine and wall childrean of those nodes, and then changed the wall's position, making it snap to the tiles differently than the shrine. He then said that he wants me to set up the building test scene differently by making it so that the building script is attachted to the node2ds, and the placing things are in their own scenes, just instanced as children of the node2ds in the building test scene. He said that in a seperate scene for the walls, he wants me to make it so that the walls change appearance when they are placed next to each other, which sounds difficult but do able. I made a new scene, set up all of the different parts of the house, and then asked Zack how he wants me to make the walls able to detect each other. I asked if areas would be ok, and he couldn't think of any other way to make it so work so he said to just use area2ds.
