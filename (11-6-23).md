I had to go back and remake the shadow enemy wander scene because the animated sprite wasn't loading the sprite so it was invisible. I then had to remake the shadow enemy multi wander because they were leaving the screen when they weren't supposed to. The shadow enemies for some reason slightly leave the screen, as if their markers are just off the screen which shouldn't be the case. The way that I fixed all the other enemies that did this didn't work on the shadow enemy, so I am not sure how to fix it. I then went through the files we had and started to rename and delete files that either had the wrong name or were now obsolete. I also incorporated the shadow enemy wandering into our scene with all of the enemies in it and they still do the same thing where they just slightly leave the screen to get to one of their markers. I checked to make sure the wasp wandering was still working in the main scene, and its still works, the markers are just a little spaced out. Now that all of the enemies wandering is done, I started to think about what they would need next. Aiden suggested that I went to the main scene and tried to get the animations to work. I added a little bit of code that should have made it so that when you enter the enemy's hitbox, it played the attack down animation, but it was playing the animation the entire time, whether the player was in the area 2d or not. I tried changing the signal that was connected, but it still just did the same thing. I then tried to scale down the markers for the wasp in the main scene, but it just made the wasp leave the scene so I will have to try and figure that out.
