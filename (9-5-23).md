We had to change and re-organize our entire project due to it breaking on Friday. I had to re-insert the sprites for the hand enemy animaiton, the shadow enemy animation, and the health bar to get them working again. The godot project then started collapsing on itself so we had to fix that before we could do anymore work. Zack finished remaking a new project folder, so once I cloned the new folder, I got to work on remaking the animations. I finished making the animations in the new project and showed Hiro how the animations work in godot.
