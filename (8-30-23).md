I went back to the sidescroller tutorial that I found yesterday, and for some reason, the problem of the animations not playing correctly suddenly stopped but it was replaced with another problem. When the character jumps, they jump way too high. I am not entirely sure how to fix this problem and I dont see anything wrong between my code and the tutorials code but I will keep working at it until I figure out how to fix it. I was able to adjust the player jumping too high by making it so the gravity is slightly stronger which successfully fixed the problem. I then tried to go back to the dodge the creeps tutorial to figure out the problem with that. What was happeneing was I was able to get a game scene, a hud, a player model, a mob model, and the mob spawn point inside the game scene, but whenever I pressed the start button, the game didn't start. I wasn't able to figure out the problem with what I tried; I copied the player and enemy nodes and put them into the game scene, and tried to add more code that would make the start button fully functional, but none of them worked and I wasn't able to find anything in the tutorial mentioning a way to fix the problem. I then got a sprite sheet of the enemy that I was tasked with animating. The only problem I faced was that I cant use the sheet as a document, it has to be a png, and I need to figure out how to flip the walking right animation to make it into a walking left animation but keep all the other animations how they should be.
