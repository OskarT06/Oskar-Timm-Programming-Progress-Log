I went back to the sidescroller tutorial that I found yesterday, and for some reason, the problem of the animations not playing correctly suddenly stopped but it was replaced with another problem. When the character jumps, they jump way too high. I am not entirely sure how to fix this problem and I dont see anything wrong between my code and the tutorials code but I will keep working at it until I figure out how to fix it.
