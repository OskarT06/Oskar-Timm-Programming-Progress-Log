Really all I did today was make a programming team for the game jam groups, and then start showing my programming partner what he needed to get started. We then went to ask Zane what idea he had for the first game we are going to make which set us onto what we have to learn. I was able to write code to make a sprite follow a path drawn with the player's finger.
