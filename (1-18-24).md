I have to figure out how to make the sprite snap to the tiles and I have to make it so you can place the sprite. I have an idea on how to make the sprite snap to a grid. I am going to try to make it so that the sprite will only get the mouse"s position is the mouse is on one of the tiles. What I tried originally was to just make it so that the sprite would detect if the mouse is over one of the building tiles, and if the mouse was, the sprite would move to the mouse's position. That didn't work so I am trying to make it so that the sprite looks for if the mouse is over a tile in a node group and then the sprite will move, but that still isn't working yet. I was able to make it so that the shrine only got the mouse's position if the tile is turned green by the mouse. Zack came and looked at it, messed around with it a little bit, did some research, and found that there is actually a built in snapping funciton that I didn't find mentioned in the godot docs. He put this snapping funtion in and the shring now snaps to a grid. I now just have to figure out the placing.
