I continued trying to make the bird walk left and right as well as up and down. None of the code that I put in to make it walk left an right won't work. It should have worked because it is the same as the code to make it walk up and down, just changed slightly so that it pays attention to the x axis and not the y. Though, for some reason, when I hit play with just the left and right code, it still walks down and just leaves the field of view. Since the code for walking up and down works, I added it to the frog, the snake, the possum, and Thanatos.
