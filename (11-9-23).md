I continued following along with part two of the building system tutorial and tried to fix the errors that came up yesterday from part one of the tutorial and its code. I was able to solve the errors that I had from yesterday in the code by making it so that everything after the variable declaration was in a set of parenthesis, and I put the word "and" in between all the set of parenthesis to make it so that the variable is detecting all of them and not just the first thing after the variable name. Zack debugged my code for a little bit and found ways to make it what the tutorial says, but also not have any error messages. Now, I am continuing to follow along with part two of the tutorial from where I left off before. I finsihed the tutorial, but for some reason, it isn't allowing me to place a building, the possible building places are not being highlighted, and the counter for the materials isn't going up when you press the end turn button.
