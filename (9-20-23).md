I helped Aiden with a couple choices that he couldn't decide on when making the walls for our game. I tried to help Ian with animating the hand and making it play the correct animations when the player interacts with the hand. I had to stop working on the shadow enemy chasing the player because Hiro was working on his own scene that had both the shadow enemy and the player in it.
