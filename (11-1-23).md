I went back to check to see if all of the enemies wandering still works. Zack came over and told me what scale to put all of the enemies at so they are all the specific size that they are supposed to be. He then told me to look at some of Davian's code to make it so that you can have multiple enemies in one scene, but they all go after their own set of markers. I then had to go through and save all of the animations scenes as resources instead of animations. Now, I have just been working on making it so that there can be multiple of one type of enemy in a single scene and each enemy will target their own set of markers. I can't make it so that they target different sets of markers, I cna only make it so that they all target the same group of markers. Zack even tried to get the enemies to work, but he couldn't get them to work properly either. I am not sure what I cuold use to make them work, or what set up I could use to try and trick it into following different markers.
