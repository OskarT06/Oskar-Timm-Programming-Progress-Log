Now that we are moving back to our original project, I have to try to figure out what to do next because the last time we worked on this, I was doing base building and couldn't figure out how to do it. After the convdrsation we had as a class, the Camping Trip team had a meeting and started discussing thngs that we need to prioritize in our game. I suggested a couple things that we could add to the game that Zack actually really liked which we will have to figure out how to add though some of them won't be very difficult for us to make because we have already made and finished somethings that will make the new features easier to make. We also learned that a new version of Godot is available that should work better than the current version so we all downloaded that. Once I downloaded 4.2, I deleted 4.1, but it set the default thing it opens the project with to 3.5.3 instead of 4.2. I just deleted 3.5.3 as well so now it automatically opens the project with 4.2.
