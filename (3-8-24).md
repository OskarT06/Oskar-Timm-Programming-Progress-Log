I might try to return to the C# tutorials I was following along with if it doesn't take them 2 hours just to not load. The tutorial loaded the first time so I can finally do the second tutorial. I just worked on the tutorials all day since Hiro didn't want anymore screenshots for the itch page. I finished 4 or 5 tutorials, and learned quite a bit more about C# then I knew before.
