I went back to working on the house and trying to make the walls change their appearance when an area2d is entered. I put areas and collision shapes on all of the walls so they are set up, I just have to make a script for them. Davian then tried to make the walls line up, but he also couldn't. Aiden went into Aesprite and adjusted the normal walls so they will be one pixel taller, hopefully making them line up with the corner walls better. I merged the art combination branch to get the new walls, but they were not included in the merge for some reason. I told Aiden and he said that it is in the branch so I merged the branch again and the walls were included. Unfortuneately, the merge deleted the areas and collision shapes which luckily didn't take very long, and I was able to see better on where the walls were lining up. For some reason, the walls still won't line up even after Aiden made it so that they should by making the walls one pixel taller than they were before which should have worked, but didn't.
