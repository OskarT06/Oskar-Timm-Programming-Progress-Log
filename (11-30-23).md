We figured out the problem with my song and why it was just continuously looping. It was because on FL Studio, I was zoomed in fairly close so it looked like I made a really long song but it was actually only 5 seconds. So what it was doing, was just playing the song extremely quickly for some reason, and then looping, so I went back to it and changed it quite a bit. I made the song considerably longer, took instruments out, added new instruments, and added a second section with a transtition in between the 2 different parts. We now have all of the songs for the game done unless the designers ask for a new one.
