I kept trying to get my enemies to work again so I can start transferring code over for other enemies. Now that Hiro changed the code around a little bit on Friday, they kind of work. Now, they move, but they move incredibly slowly. Hiro adjusted my code a little bit more and was able to get the enemies working again. Now that they are working again, I pushed the code to the enemies branch in github, so that Ia and I couls start putting the code into scenes with other enemies so that all of the enemies have wander capabilites. I merged Zack's art branch into the enemies branch so I could gain access to the sprite for the wasp to animate and make it wander. After I finished animating the wasp, I started putting in the wandering. I have now put the wander mechanics in for the vulture, bat, frog, and wasp. I then told Thomas what to do to put one of the wandering enemies into the test scene he is working on to test if they work.
