We can't make anymore sound effects yet because Aiden isn't here today and he is the one with all of the recordings and the recording app on his phone. I was able to make it so that when the enemy gets trapped in the bear trap, it continues attacking down like it is trying to break the bear trap and ignores the player. I asked Zack what else the bear trap should do after telling him what I have it doing so far, and he said that he wants the enemy to be able to break the bear trap after a certain amount of hits. The first thought that came to mind after he said this was to set a timer after the enemy is caught and make the bear trap disappear after the timer runs out to make it look like the bear trap is being broken. I looked in the docs to see if there is a method to make it so that I can make a timer in the code instead of a node. I started trying to make the bear trap disappear, but for some reason, when the timer runsout, the bear trap doesn't disappear and the enemy can't start moving again. Somehow while I was waiting to see if the enemy would be able to break out of the trap, the enemy killed me. I am not sure how it happened, so I am doing the exact same thing again to see if it happens again. So far the enemy is still just stuck in the trap. I was wathcing closer this time, and after a certain amount of time, it just displays the death screen event though the enemy is still stuck in the trap and not anywhere near the player.
