I went back to finishing the video that I found yesterday that should supposedly help with the enemy patrolling. The video that I found worked so now we have a system to make it so that an enemy will bounce between as many markers as I want and actually picks a random path between them. Now that I have the wander test working, I started trying to incorporate the wander system into the other enemies and try to get their animations working with it as well. The first approach I took didn't work so I have to try it a different way. The first thing I tried was to copy te the node that contains the wandering capabilities into the scenes that I created the enemy animations in. Now I am going to try to copy and paste the nodes that I used to make the wander test and just adjust them so they are for specific enemies instead of a test enemy. Zack told us to stop working on the enemies for a little bit because he was going to go through and change the names of all of them so it is easier to see instead the names just being numbers. He also finished a bat enemy so I started working on animating that. Once I finished that, Zack came watched the aniamtions that I have done so far and asked if I could change the speed for a few of them. I went through and changed the ones he said. I had to redo the animations for the vulture enemy so that it would be an animatedsprite2D instead of a sprite and an animation player. I then started to try and make it so that when an enemy hits a marker and goes to pick a random one to move to, it waits a second before moving. I found a way to do this, suggesting that I use an area2D and just attach a signal to the enemy telling it that when it enters that area2D to pause and wait before moving again. This didn't work so I will have to look for a new way or combine multiple to make my own.
