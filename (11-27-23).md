I started off by figuring out what I should start with since the last time I worked on Camping Trip, I found out that we can't really make a building system without a plug-in that costs moremoney than it should. Once I heard that we were continuing to work on the game jam for another week, I started to think about what I could do on this game jam because the last time we worked on it, Davian's subscription for FL Studio ended so now we can't save any songs we make and some of changes we made to one of our songs didn't save. Since my designers decided to start using a different engine, there isn't really anything that I can help with because I don't nkow anything about the new engine. I am not sure how we are going to remake or move our entire game over to the new engine but I guess the new engine will work better for our game idea than godot. Once Luke got the github up and working for the new engine, I added myself to it and then made a new music branch for whatever songs Davian and I make for it.
