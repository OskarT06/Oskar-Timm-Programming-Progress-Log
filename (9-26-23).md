I went back to the tutorial that I found yesterday to continue making a patrol and a chase ability for the bird enemy. I was able to successfully merge the code to make the bird walk up and down while playing its animations, and the player chase code. However, the bird still doesn't chase the player properly. The bird also can't move for some reason. It still plays the animations, but it doesn't actually move or chase. I was able to test my bird code on one of the other enemies and learned that my code will work, I just have to change some of the code accordingly with what nodes were used to make the scene.
