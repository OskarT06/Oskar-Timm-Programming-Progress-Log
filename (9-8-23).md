I continued following along with the tutorial that I found yesterday to try and figure out the issues with the enemy, such as; getting the enemy to actually play animations, and getting it to actually chase the player properly. Ian had an issue with the hand enemy where it was just playing the animations too fast. I took a stab at it and was able to fix it and make the animtions play at the right speed and only play one at a time. I now realized that the tiles I used to make the temporary map to test the enemy chasing the player are too small and now that the player's size was adjusted, the enemy is too big and the player is too small for the enemy to see him so the enemy no longer targets the player because they are too small. Zack finished the wolf enemy while I was following the tutorial so I gave it a break for a little bit and animated the wolf enemy. Once I fincished animating the wolf enemy, I went back to trying to make the shadow enemy chase the player. We then had a team meeting to discuss the nitty gritty details of the game that haven't been fully decided on.
