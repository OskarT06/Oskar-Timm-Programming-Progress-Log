I am going to start looking in the godot documentation to see if there are other ways to accomplish what I am trying to do. I found a couple other functions that I am going to try to see if they work better than what I already have. I am trying to add new variable like can_follow_mouse so that I can set it to false when the sprite shouldn't be able to move, but it isn't working. I am not sure if I am missing something or if something I have is countering something else I have and just making it follow the mouse constantly. Davian found some code that might work for what I am trying, so once I finish my current attempt, if it doesn't work, I'll try to code that he found. He said that I do have to add some things to it since it is more of an outline than actual code, so I'll have to figure out what I need to add to get it to work. I changed it so that right click will now make it so that the sprite stops following the mouse, and shift cancels the building. Zack checked in on Ian and I and I showed him the issue that I was having, and he wrote a new variable, added someting to one of my if statements, and set the variable to false which made the building system work. So now, when the sprite is invisible and left click is pressed, it appears, when it is visible and left clicked is pressed again, it stops where it is and stops moving. Now that the building system mostly works, I have to figure something else out to work on unless Zack wants me to do something else with the building system scene.
