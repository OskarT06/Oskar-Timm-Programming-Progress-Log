Zack finished with the base building scene so I went through and started building on what he made. He has code to make the walls rotateable and asked if I could take that code and make it so that you can also rotate the corners. It was fairly easy since Zack already had the underlying code that I needed to make the corners work. After that, I had to pull from Zack's branch aagain because there was a problem with the rotating of the corners making it so the offset was wrong. This added some new things that hindered me from being able to place something. Zack had to come over and go through it because when I did what he said to do, it didn't change anything. After a little while and a bit of trouble shooting, he was able to fix it and now the rotating works for all of the walls except the door which I don't will be rotateable. Now I have to make it so that the walls have an area that turns the wall red when it detects another collision shape inside of it and so you can't place it if it is red but the area is deleted when the wall is placed. It hopefully won't be too difficult since it should be similar to what I had to do with the collision shapes. My first attempt didn't work and I am not sure what Zack wants me to do with a function he made, so I'll have to ask him. I found a couple other problems, but Zack is in a designer meeting so I can't ask him. Hiro took a look at it and explain better what an error message ment which allowed me to fix it. I found that now if the wall is red, you can't place it when you left click, but it still opens the building menu. He said that I will have to go into the player code to stop this from happening, but he is working on the player right now so I have to wait until he is finished with the player.
