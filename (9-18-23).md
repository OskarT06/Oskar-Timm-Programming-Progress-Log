We started reviewing Godot 3.5 and looking at all of the different nodes that it has. We were checking if the nodes that we already use are still in 3.5 and they are with more nodes that are a combination between multiple nodes we need that 4.0 and 4.1 don't have. I downloaded Godot 3.5 and started looking to see how I need to make the animations since I will have to redo all of them. We decided against using 3.5 because the cons outweighed the pros and we would have had to completely rework entire things that we have spent weeks working on. I went back to rewrite the code for the enemy to hope that it will fix it not chasing the player.
