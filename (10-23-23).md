I started off by going back to trying to figure out how to make it so that the animations for the frog work properly when it is moving in the corresponding direction with what animation it is supposed to be playing. I encountered a problem that I don't know what it was caused by. The frog only goes to one point which is that same every time I hit play no matter what marker it is targeting, then stops at that point, and doesn't move anymore while continuously printing its next target and that it got to a point. Zack was able to figure out what the problem was with Hiro's assisstance and me telling him what different sections of the code did and now it works. It plays the walking up and down animations, so I just have to figure out how to get it to play the walking left and right animations as well as the looking animation. Once I can figure this out, I should be able to start implementing the code for other enemies. I got the left and right animations to work somewhat, but there are a few errors. For example, I can't get the left and right animations working as well as the up and down animations because I have to say var animationString = "walk_left", but I can't say that because I already said the same thing for walking up and down and I can't have two of the same variable declared in the same scope. I was able to get the animations kind of working, but it only plsays the walking left and right animations, it doesn't play that walking up and down animations. I tried a couple different ways to get this to work, such as making the animations in an animationplayer, then turning them into a state machine in an animationtree, but that didn't work, so I tried adjusting the script making the walking up and down animations play whe the velocity.y > 0 but that didn't work either. I'll have to do a little more research to figure this out.
