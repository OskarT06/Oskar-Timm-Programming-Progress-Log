I am not sure what I need to work on today. I finished the tool testing and I don't know if Zack wants me to continue working on that and add new things or just not add anything new until after the projet review. Zack seems a little preoccupied right now so I am not going to bug him. I can try to make it so that thwne the tree or rock are harvested, they give you the materials they are supposed to. I am not sure how I would make the materials appear in the player's inventory when the tree or rock is harvested, but Hiro is busy trying to make the executable so I don't want to distract him. Aiden went into the Taiga to find something that he could make, and found that there need to be paintings so he had me come over and make a painting. Zack also said that he wants me to continue working on base building so I have to figure out what to do next for that. I went back to the building scene, and it isn't working the same as it was before. The way Zack changed it made it so that when you place one base part and then click again, another base part would appear. For some reason, something is preventing that from happening and only one wall is placeable. I am not sure how to solve the problem of only wall being visible at a time because I don't understand how Zack set it up and he didn't have enough time to explain it. Turns out that there was a seperate scene that was created where everything was working that I completely forgot about.
