After Hiro made some changes to the player, I had to change somethings around in the building system. One of the major problems that I had made it so that I couldn't change the tool I had equipped so I couldn't build. Ian showed me how to fix this since Hiro showed him how to fix it. After that, trying to place something would crash the scene. I asked Hiro and it was because one of the functions in the code for the building panel had the incorrect name compared to what Hiro changed it to so once I changed the function's name, building worked. I have to figure out some way to make it so that if you cancel building something, or can't place it, it doesn't spend the materials. This would probably be a good thing to ask Hiro since he made all of the crafting and material using systems. I looked through the code used in the building scene to see if I could find where it uses the materials and figure out how it works. I asked Hiro where the actual crafting code was because I couldn't tell what the code was doing, and he found it and showed me how to fix the problem. I now just have to figure out how to make it so that when you try to place a red wall, the building menu doesn't come back up, and when opening other menus such as the inventory, the wall will dissappear. After I made it so that the materials aren't used when you try to place a red wall, for some reason, you can't select a wall. You can click on the wall's button to place it, but the wall doesn't appear. I found what was preventing a wall from being selected and the building menu closing. Turns out I just had a close function and a return in the wrong place so it wouldn't close the menu. I am running into problems making it so that if you click to place something when you can't place it, the building menu is not opened. I went through and found a couple other bugs such as the code that I changed was preventing materials from being used when placing a wall. I showed Hiro and he said it was because of a return that was no longer needed in the code. Once I got rid of it, the materials were being used again.
