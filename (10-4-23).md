I went back to trying to figure out how to make it so that the player draws a path for the character to follow, almost like snake or pac man. None of the code or tutorials I found showed how to make it so that for a set amount of time, you can draw a pathand after the timer ends, the character begins to follow the path. We may just have to work with what I have working now, considering the deadline we have. I started working on a system to make multiple sprites follow the first one on the path that I draw for it. I got close on my first try by adding my script from the original sprite to all the other sprites and just adjusting the speed slightly for each of them to make them all follow the path, just at different speeds to make them look like they are following each other. However, the two slowest sprites stop moving if I make the first one move too much until it stops moving, then the slowest two start moving again to catch up. I was able to assist Davian with something that he needed help with. He needed to make it so when you click on a sprite, it prints a message and then disappears. We couldn't figure out how to make it so that when the other sprites are clicked on, they print incorrect and nothing happens until you clikc on the correct one, so we just went back to what we had before that worked.
