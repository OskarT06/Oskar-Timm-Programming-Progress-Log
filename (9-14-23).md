Zack, Thomas, and I started discussing details for the rifle that we are going to be putting into our game. We talked about things like whether we should make it an automatic rifle or a lever action, how much time we want to be in between each shot, whether or not you would have to make more bullets or the player has infinite ammo, and whether or not the player would have to reload. I then went over and checked in with Aoden, and helped him come up with some designs he could use on the wooden walls we are going to use in game. Aiden then asked if I saw anything about something else he is making that he could add to make it look better.
