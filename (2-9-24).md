I have to add the wall buttons to the blueprints tabd, but Hiro is working on it in one of his scenes so I can't work on it at the moment. I merged from the art combination branch to get the new updated sprites for the walls. I went to my base_part scene and changed the animation frames to the new ones. Once I finished that, I went to my house test scene to test to see if they lined up properly. A few of the walls are off, but Zack was able to find a slight soulution. He changed the scale of the walls back to 1 instead of 0.991 which made them line up a little better, but the corners are still off. He changed the snap offset on the bottom left corner, making that one line up properly. He told me to take the snap interval snap offset, and difference, and copy and paste them into the other walls, then adjut them accordingly ot make all of the walls line up properly.
