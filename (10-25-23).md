Zack told me that we are going to do our review today, so he came over and checked out my code to see if he could figure it out. He was able to solve what was going on, and I was able to fine tune it so that it is incorporated into the standard enemy. Once I tried to put it into Hiro's scene however, I saw a few problems. At first, the standard enemy was moving too fast which was an easy fix, but now it doesn't bounce between the markers, it only goes to one and then stops moving. I also can't put the enemy wandering into Hiro's scene because when I try to hit play, it closes the game window and only does that for me and no one else. The enemies that I made wandering capabilities for both broke in the same way and I have no idea how to fix either of them. I think I may have figured out what is going wrong with the enemies, but I'm not sure how to fix it. The enemies are going to (0,0) instead of one of the markers, then stopping there, selecting a new target but not moving towards its target.
