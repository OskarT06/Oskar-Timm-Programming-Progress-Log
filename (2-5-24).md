I went back to the tool testing scene to finish that up since I don't think it is being put into our scene for project review so it won't conflict with anything. I also had to try to figure out how to make it so that the tree and rock don't play the harvesting animation again even after they have been harvested and are clicked on again. This was a simple fix and I just made it so that thwne the tree or rock is clicked on, the area2ds collision shape is disabled and then re-enabled when the timer runs out. I now have to make a ui that the tool bar is part of so it moves with the player instead of just being a stationary square in the scene. I asked Hiro how he would want me to make the tool bar, and Zack showed me how we have it set up currently. He said that I should go to a different scene, make the tool bars in that, and then instance that scene into the player_nodes scene where the rest of the GUI is. I started it, but I have no experience with making a ui so Zack came over and hsowed me how to do it. Once it was finished, I instanced the ToolBar_ui scene into the player_nodes scene, and then instanced the player nodes scene into my tool testing scene instead of the player I already had so I could get all of the gui parts. Zack showed me what to do to make the mouse cursor the correct one, which I need to keep in mind for the other scnes that I make.
