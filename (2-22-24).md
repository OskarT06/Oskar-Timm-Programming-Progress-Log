I am going back to the house test scene to make the final changes I need to get it done. I changed the collision shape on the door wall so it now has multiple parts and an area for the door detection. I now have to try and figure out how to make it so that I can connect the body entered signal from the door wall collision scene into the small object placing scene. I tried to make it so that there are multiple collision shapes on the door and one of them ahd an area atteached to it to detect when the player enters the it, but that was the only collsion the player couldn't walk through. I showed Zack and he said to juat make 2 other scenes for each collision shape that will be part of the door. I did that and made new variables for the other 2 collision parts so that the door will instantiate all of the collision shapes at the same time instead of just 1 or 2. I started adding code that when you click on the door, it opens and you can walk through it and can close the door with another click. I got it work most of the way, but I can't disable the collision shape of the doorway so you can walk through it when the door is open and can't when the door is closed. Zack changed over to my scene on my branch and started addinng things so I stepped back to make sure we don't have conflicting changes. He figured out how to make it so that the walls are transparent when you are placing them and how to make it so that you can walk through the open door but not the closed door.
