I continued following along with the tutorial that I found trying to finish the game to see if what I did worked. A lot of what I did while following along with this tutorial were things like making the character animate and move around the screen when specific buttons were pressed. A couple factors in the code kept it from working the I didn't understand like setting the starting position of the character the someone would play as. I tried a couple different types of code snippets that the website suggested to help fix certain problems, but they just stayed errors. The website suggested that I put in different key phrases for different versions of Godot to see if they solved my problem. I tried to fix them a few times myself by just fiddling around but that didn't fix the errors either. I tried changing certain words and adding different transitional symbols to connect two lines that were errors. Once we got closer to class ending and the errors just stayed the same and didn't get any better, I closed the project to take a break and see if coming back later would help me understand what the problem was.
