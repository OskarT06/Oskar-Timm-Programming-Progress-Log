I started by helping Ian with trying to make the hand enemy play certain animations when the player enters its vacinity. He needs to make it so the hand plays the animation of it emerging from water and then stop on the last frame, then play the reatreatng animation when the player leaves the vacinity which then transfers into the normal idle animation. The problem is that he can get 2/3 of the animations working, but when the emerging animation works, the retreating animation doesn't work and vice versa. Since Hiro is still using the shadow enemy, I changed to the bird enemy because it should be sleightly easier to code because it has an actual idle animation. Zack finisehd making the sprite sheet for Thanatos so I animated that once he pushed it.
