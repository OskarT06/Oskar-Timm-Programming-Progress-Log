I continued following along with the tutorial that I found trying to finish the game to see if what I did worked. A couple factors in the code kept it from working the I didn't understand like setting the starting position of the character the someone would play as. I tried a couple different types of code snippets that the website suggested to help fix certain problems, but they just stayed errors. I tried to fix them a few times myself by just fiddling around but that didn't fix the errors either. I closed the project to take a break and see if coming back later would help me understand what the problem was.
