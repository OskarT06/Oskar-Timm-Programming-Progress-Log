I went back to where I left off yesterday with trying to get the frog to play the correct animations that correspond with the direction it is walking. I looked for a tutorial on how to do it, and I found a person showing their code and saying what their problem was and asking for a fix. Once I put in all of the code, I changed the parts that I needed to in order to maek it correspond to the nodes and node ames that I have. The ode still didn't work however, just making the frog sit in one place and just play the walking right animation.
