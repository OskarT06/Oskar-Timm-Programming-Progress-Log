I went back to where I left off yesterday with trying to get the frog to play the correct animations that correspond with the direction it is walking. I looked for a tutorial on how to do it, and I found a person showing their code and saying what their problem was and asking for a fix. Once I put in all of the code, I changed the parts that I needed to in order to maek it correspond to the nodes and node ames that I have. The ode still didn't work however, just making the frog sit in one place and just play the walking right animation. The code that I made myself had multiple sprites, one for each animation, but I couldn't figure out how to show and hide specific sprites that only show a certain animation. I was able to make it so they all moved along the the points. Now for some reason, I reopened my old scene where the movement was working but not the sprites all at once, and it gives me an error that it didn't give me before. I forgot how to fix the error code, though luckily, Zack remembered how to do it so we fixed it and the point wandering is working again. I still have the same issue with all of the sprites showing at the same time, but once I figure out how to fix that, everything will work, hopefully. I was able to help Daivan with an issue that he had. He needed to make it so that when the player walks into a collision shape, it completely stops moving and just starts playing the idle animaiton until you walk away. I used some parts of my code that I used in the enemy to make it so stop completely and do certain things, then put in a line to make it so that it plays the idle animation when the player can't move and surprisingly, it worked perfectly first try.
