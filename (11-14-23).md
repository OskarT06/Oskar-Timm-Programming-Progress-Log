I continued logging in to everything that I had to since I am on a different computer. Now that there are few people here, I started FL Studio downloading. It finished very quickly since I was the only person downloading anything. I then downloaded Aesprite just in case I am needed to make something for the game. I moved over next to Davian since he has experience with FL Studio and is now on our team so I had to redownload FL Studio. I shouldn't have to worry about Aesprite since Thomas is here now so there are more artists. I tried to make a test track in FL Studio, but for some reason, the audio doesn't work and it won't even play. I asked Davian and he said to make an audio MIDI setup, but that also didn't work. I am not sure where to go from here because working on a song is really all I have been told or asked to do. I can't work on something on Aesprite because it isn't downloaded on this new computer, and since FL Studio is being difficult, I have to try and fiz it before to long. I looked back in the sound menu, set the output back to the mac studio built in speakers, and now it works. However, even if I did get a song working, I haven't been added to the github yet so I can't add it. I tried helping Ian and Aiden with coding the dialog and trying to make it interactable, but they have more experience with 3.5 and UI stuff than I do, so my advice isn't really much help for them. I then learned that I am going to have to figure out how to export audio files from FL Studio into godot and make it so that godot accepts the audio files because we had issues with godot not accepting the audio files in Camping Trip. I helped Aiden troubleshoot a problem he was struggling with because he was trying to get a free plugin to work but it said that it couldn't enable the plugin because there was an error in the code so I helped him fix the errors and now the plugin should work.
