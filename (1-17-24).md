I went back to trying to figure out how to make it so that the sprite follows the mouse and can be placed. I feel like making it so the shrine can be placed will be the hardest part because I have to make so that not only does it stop moving and get placed where the mouse is clicked, but also so that if the player left clicks again, the sprite stays in the same place. I found a short video that I followed along with, but it didn't work. I went to the documentation and started reading up on things involving something following the mouse. Ian made some changes to the player so that it has collision shapes around it and they will detect if the mouse is clicked inside of the shape to play the specific swinging animations. I was able to make it so that the sprite will be at the mouse'sposition, but it only does it when left click is pressed. I added another if statement saying the when the mouse has motion, the sprite's position will be set to the mouse's position which worked perfectly. I just have to figure out the placing now.
