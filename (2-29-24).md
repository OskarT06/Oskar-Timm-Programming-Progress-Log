I still can't think of any other features to add to our game, so I might check to see if anyone else has any ideas. If they don't, I'll keep thinking. I don't really know of anything to do and Hiro hasn't told me anything I should work on, so I am just going to wait until someone needs help and try to help them in the ways I can. Marshall is teaching Hiro c sharp, so he is a little preoccupied at the moment.
