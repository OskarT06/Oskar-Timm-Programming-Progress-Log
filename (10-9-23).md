I tried working on where I left off with trying to make the house detect the player when the area is entered. I wasn't able to get it working on time. For some reason the area2D just wouldn't detect the collision shape on the player and wouldn't print that the player won the game. Since we are back working on our own games, I continued to try and make it so that the enemies can walk left and right instead of just up and down. I found code that kind of did something, it made it so the enemy would still walk up and down, but it played the walking right animation. I was able to help Ian slightly with a problem that he had. He was trying to make the wolf chase the player and I was able to fix a debugger error and keep the wolf from just despawning when the player enters the area of the wolf, but now the wolf runs away from the player, and then mimics the player's movement instead of trying to chase it. After our team meeting, we figured out which specific things we are going to focus on and what our goals and milestones should be. I was tasked with making a set patrol area for an enemy instead of random patrolling. I found a video to help with my new task.
