# Progress-Log
First Week
(8/12/23): I met the poeple in the class and got to know them a little bit better to figure out which poeple I would be able to work the best with. This helped later down the line when I already know some of the people in the group I joined and I already knew that I could work with them. Learning names helped when I needed to ask them more in depth quesitons, but it also gave me a chance to connect with them and begin establishing a bond.

(8/17/23): I set up the computer I would be working on. This was the first time I have ever done anthing like that which showed me that I have the ability to solve problems and do things I have never done before by just trying and figuring it out as I go. Once my computer was fully set up, I started downloading and setting up accounts on the apps that I would need such as xcode, unreal engine, discord, blender, github, and taiga.

(8/18/23): I started looking at tutorials to learn different skills that I would need. The first turtorial I looked up was a tutorial to make a simple donut in blender. I focused on that for a little while until I realized that learning to code was probably more important. I then looked up a tutorial for unreal engine, and began my process of trail and error to try and learn the main components.
