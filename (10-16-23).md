I went back to rying to make the basic shadow enemy pause at points instead of just moving the entire time. I tried changing what signal was connected from the timer to the enemy code, but none of the different things that I tried worked. I started trying to implement that wander mechanics for some of the other enemies, starting with the frog. I put everything in, but when i hit play, it gives me the same Invalid get index 'position' (on base: 'Nil') error code that I have no idea how to fix. I was able to go to the original test scene that I made and was able to change the sprite from the test sprite to the frog. When I hit play, it gave me the same error as before but I found a way to change the script so it doesn't show the error anymore. I changed the code from (current_position.position) to just (position). This made it so that it actually starts playing and the frog begins moving, but it jusst goes to one point and then stops moving completely. I put the current_target.position back in and changed the group_name from FrogEnemy back to group_name, and it suddenly just decided to start working. I was able to make it so that the frog plays an animation when it is at a point while the timer is going, and then when the timer timesout, it stops playing the animations. Zack finished making the sprite sheet for our turtle enemy, so I animated it once he pushed it. I didn't have to change any of the speeds either because he said that they were fine at 5 fps.
