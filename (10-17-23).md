I continued making paths for the enemy to patrol. I cleared up a misconception I had with the patrol path references that Zack drew for me to use, so I made the standard patrol area for the frog enemy and luckily everything still works. Now that everything works properly, I was able to figure out how to make it so that when the enemy stops moving, it plays an animation. However, when I put in the walking animations and put it code to make the enemy play the specific animaitons when walking a specific direction, it prevents the looking animation from playing and it doesn't play the walking animations. It only plays that first frames of the walk left and walk right animations. I realized that the problem was that all of the animations were in same AnimatedSprite2D, so I tried making it so that each animation was in a different AnimatedSprite2D and I changed the code to make it so that only one of the nodes will play the animation at a time instead of all of them at once. I couldn't get it to work with multiple different nodes because they would all be visible and playing at the same time and I couldn't figure out how to make it so that it would hide that sprite until a specific thing happened such as the enemy stopping moving, or it moving left, right, up, or down. I got it to sort of work when moving to the right, but there are still definitely some major kinks to work out.
