It took us a while, but we now have our team and not a game (jam) idea. Hiro and Marshall are setting up the project, so the rest of us can start working when they add us to the github. Hiro added us to the github, but I am not sure what they want me to work on. I am not sure if we have a definite starting place or if Hiro is just going to start working. Aiden and I started watching a video of what Conway's Game of Life even looks like since that is what we are basing our game off of, and found that people have made some pretty cool stuff in that "game".
