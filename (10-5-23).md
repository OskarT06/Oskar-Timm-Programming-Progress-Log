I continued trying to get multiple sprites to follow behind each other. I still can't use godot engine to try and solve my problem because they are moving all of the information somewhere else so the website is down. I couldn't find any code so I am trying to give them collision shapes to make it so they physically can not collide with each other to try to eliminate them overlapping. I finally fixed the problem with assistance from Hiro. All I had to do was make it so a Node2D was the scene root, and all of the sprites were then children of other Node2Ds making it so that none of them shared any factors. There is an occasional thing that happens where one of the sprites will just jump out of the line and go the the front of all of the other sprites. This problem is fixed when you draw the path with the mouse slower, but I encourntered another problem that I have no idea how to fix. When I pulled from the main branch to get the assets for my game, it shrunk the viewport size, so I had to adjust the sprites accordingly. That wasn't a big deal, but when I move them into the viewport and press play to try and get the sprites to move, they don't move and the camera just slides away from them even though there isn't a camera. I figured out that it is really just because the window is so much smaller than it is before so the speed of the sprites make it so that I barely move the mouse and they all move too far. I tried adjusting the speed and it definitely helped, but the mouse controlling them is still weird. The way it moves makes it look like it is somewhere other than where it is on the screen.
