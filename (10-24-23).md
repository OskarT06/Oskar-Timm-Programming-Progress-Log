I went back ot trying to make the animations work the way they are supposed to so I can implement the wandering with the other enemies. I was able to make the animations work correctly with the walk right and walk left animations while playing the looking animations when it isn't moving. However, since the walking left and right animations were working, the walking up and down animaitons weren't working. Zack took a look at it and tried a couple different methods he knew of that supposedly would of worked, but like everything I have been trying, when one thing worked, something else didn't. We ran into a problem making it so that the animations work perfectly except when the enemy is walking in a diagonal line. Once it walks in a diaganol line, the debug screen either crashes and closes, or no animation plays. Since the diagonal walking animations aren't working though, all of the other animations are working because we also got rid of the looking animation. I am not sure how we will fix the diagonal walking, but I'm sure that Zack, Hiro, and I will be able to figure something out.
