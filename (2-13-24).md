I went back to my walls script and found that other scripts were open. I looked to see what the other scripts were for and found that the script I thought all of my working code was on was actually the wrong script even though I could have sworn that before the merge yesterday, I was working on the walls script and not the small object placing script. I at least found my script so I can get back to making the walls line up correctly and integrating the buttons into the blueprints tab of the inventory. I am trying to make the side walls line up with the corners, but for some reason, no matter how I change the snap offset, it doesn't change how the side wall lines up. I finally got them to line up better, and I now have found that there is a small problemn with the collision shapes of the walls which will be an easy fix. I have now gotten it so that all of the walls line up properly, they all have the correct collision shapes, and the z index works properly for all of them. Next, I have to try to figure out how to make it so that the door had a collision shape, but also has an area2d that detects the player and plays that animation of the door opening so the player can walk through the door and enter the house that they have built.
