Zack made a new sprite yesterday for the enemy animations so I could get attack and walk left animations. I went back to working on that and I unfortunately had to redo all of the animations because since I replaced the original sprite sheet with a new one, I had to redo all of the animations which luckily didn't take very long since I already did them yesterday and already knew what to do. The animations for the base shadow enemy in our game are now done. Once I finished the enemy animations, I then tried to put them into our main project on godot. At first it wasn't working because the character model just wouldn't pop up so I tried to just copy and paste the scene directly, I tried to open the scene as a new scene. Neither of those worked. Finally I figured it out that the sprite sheet was not loaded into the Sprite2D node and once I put the sprite sheet in, it fixed the problem and everything went back to working perfectly.
