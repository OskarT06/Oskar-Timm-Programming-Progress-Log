Zack made a new sprite yesterday for the enemy animations so I could get attack and walk left animations. I went back to working on that and I unfortunately had to redo all of the animations because since I replaced the original sprite sheet with a new one, I had to redo all of the animations which luckily didn't take very long since I already did them yesterday and already knew what to do. The animations for the base shadow enemy in our game are now done.
