I went back to trying to figure out how ot make it so that the bird can walk between four points to test if all of the animations work. I found a reddit post of someone showing their code and aksing for someone to help making it better. I put that code into the script for the enemy, and the code to make it move up and down works, and I was able to modify it slightly and add my own code to make it play the correct animations when moving up and down, but it can't fly left and right which is still something that I have to figure out. I found more code that should allow it to fly all 4 directions alternatingly, but unfortuately, when I put the code in, it only flies down and doesn's stop to then turn around and start flying up.
