I have to keep trying to figure out why my building system stopped working. I went into the player scene and tried deleting the button nodes and it fixed the sprites not detecting the mouse. I worked on making it so that the player only turns normal tiles red, reverts red tiles to normal, the mouse only turns normal tiles green, and reverts green tiles to normal, and the shrine that is alreay "placed" turns the tile it is on urple and nothing can change it from purple. It took me a little while to figure out how to do it but the way I got it to work was by making it so that the player looks for normal tiles and can only turn them red if they don't already have a color and can only turn red tiles back to normal. I did the same thing with the mouse, and just set the "placed" shrine's tile to purple. This made it so now the purple tile stays purple, and the green and red tiles won't override each other if you drag the mouse over a tile that has been turned red. I still need to figure out the mosue following and placing only on tiles, though I don't think it'll be too hard.
