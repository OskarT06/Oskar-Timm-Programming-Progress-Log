I went back to making it so that the walls of the house change their appearance when near other walls. It shouldn't be too tough with areas. All of the wall pieces follow the mouse, I just have to make it so that they appear and can be placed one at a time. I had to help Zack with getting the tool testing scene that I helped Aiden make because it wasn't on his branch and he couldn't find it. I then showed Aiden that the walls of the house that he made don't line up properly. He tried to figure out if it was just a problem of where they were placed, or if it was just a conflict between godot and aesprite but it wasn't. I then helped Thomas figure out which things I edited and which things I didn't so he could do a merge to get the tool test scene that me and Aiden made. I was able to get the house walls to line up a little better, but it still isn't the same as aesprite. I am not sure why the walls aren't lining up or how to fix it. I also have to figure out how to make the walls be placeable one at a time instead of all at once.
