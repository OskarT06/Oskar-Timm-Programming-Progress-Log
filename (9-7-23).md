I was asked to continue trying to find code to make the shadow enemy randomly walk around. I found a tutorial that I started following along with to hopefully make it so that the base shadow enemy will be able to chase after the player if they get close enough and attack them within a certain range. I had to make a temporary tile map to test whether or not the enemy would chase the player when the player comes within their detection radius. It didn't work at first but once I realized that the player was on the wrong layer so the enemy coulnd't detect it. Once I fixed the layer issue however, the enemy was able to detect the player. There are still a few wrinkles I have to fix such as getting the enemy to actually follow the player instead of just jumping to them, making the enemy wander around when it doesn't detect the player, and making the enemy play the walk animaiton that corresponds with the direction it is walking/facing. The tutorial I found that showed me how to make the enemy follow the player should cover how to fix these issues though.
