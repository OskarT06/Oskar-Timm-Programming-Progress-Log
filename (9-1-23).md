I started by looking for things to help Ian with his aniamtion tree troubles because we are tring to get the animations for the player to work when he is facing a specific direction. I animated the health bar for our game to show what it will look like when the player gets damaged. I unfortunately have to redo the previous enemy animatinons that I did, but the good part is that they will now all be under the same project and they won't be super blurry like they were before when I did them all on separate projects. Now that I know how to do the animatinos correctly, I was able to animate all of the enemies extremely quickly. I have now animated 3 different things in our main godot project; the base shadow enemy, the hand enemy that emerges from water, and the health bar. There are still quite a few more animations to do, but luckily these are done, saved, and fully working.
