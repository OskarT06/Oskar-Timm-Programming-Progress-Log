Zack is still adding things to my building scene, and then I think that Hiro is going to change something. I might just wait until Davian and Aiden are done with what they are doing and then we can make some sound effects. There are a couple new ones we have to make, and a few that we have to remake. I saw that Ian needed help with the hand and trying to make it damage the player. I told him to change what player was in the scene with the hand so he could have all of the ui. I also tried to make it so that the hand will only go away if you attack it with the knife and not tools like the lantern or net. I couldn't get it to work and for some reason, the only thing I was able to make it do was that the hand would only grab you if you had the knife selected, but would just make the character freeze in place if anything else was selected. I was able to fix this, but when you hit the hand with the knife, the hand wouldn't go away and the player wouldn't be able to move after that.
