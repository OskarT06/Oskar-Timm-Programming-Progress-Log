Once Davian arrives, we will be able to start transferring the songs we made over to a new computer that has a paid version of FL Studio on it to get them into the game. Now that he is here, we are trying to figure out if there is a way we can export the songs that we have made that still saved from Davian's computer to the computer with the paid version of FL Studio, and then start working on the songs that we need to make or the ones that we couldn't save. We found that we actually don't have to use the computer with the paid version of FL Studio because we can still export the songs without the paid version, we just can't save them. Davian was able to get the acceptance ending song back to what we had before, and then I started making the denial ending song. I made the start of the song and then Davian went through to see what he wanted to add or change. Davian added another instrument in the background, and I added an effect that makes it sound a little more spooky and makes the song sound like it is echoing. Something strange then started happening with Davian's computer where all of his wix posts were deleted and he couldn't get out of the screen of the FL Studio mobile. I was able to figure out how to close the FL Studio mobile screen by finding the hot key for changing tabs and we were able to export the denial ending song we made and close the FL Studio mobile tab. However, all of his wix posts are still deleted and I am not sure how to get them back.
