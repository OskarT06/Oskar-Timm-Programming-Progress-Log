I went through and tried all of the games that I could and rated them all accordingly. A few of the games couldn't be opened so I gave them lower scores since some of them didn't even have a game. For example, the Velvet Worm game, was just assets and didn't have a game file only assets and scripts. I don't think that all of us have finished our rating and voting, so I am just waiting for everyone else to finish. I think that the last time we were working on camping trip, Zack was working on the building scene I was working on so I can't work on it yet because I don't think that he has finished with it yet. I think that it has been decided among our group that we are going to take a break today and continue working on camping trip on a different day, but I don't know for sure. Everyone has sort of been doing their own things today, so we might pick back up on camping trip tomorrow.
