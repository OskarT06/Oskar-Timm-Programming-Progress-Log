I continued working on the other logs that I hadn't finished yesterday. I found a new tutorial that shows me how to make a simple sidescroller game. I have been followeing along with this and have learned quite a bit, like how to adjust gravity for jumping mechanics, how to add a double jump, how to make a tile map, and how to give the tile map a hit box so the player doesn't just fall straight through the floor.
