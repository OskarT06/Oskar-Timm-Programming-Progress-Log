I started with more trying to make the shrine srite follow the mouse. I am going to try to make it so that the Area2D will detect the mouse and they will turn green if the mouse enters the area and red if the player enters the area. I have made it so that the mouse turns the tiles green, and they go back to normal when the mouse exits the area. However, it turns the red tiles green which I don't want it to do. I made it so that the area detects what color the tile is when the mouse enters the area, and it only changes the tile back to its normal color if the mouse has already turned it green so if the tile is red, the mouse won't turn it green and won't change the tiles color back to the normal color when exiting the area. I now have to figure out how to make it so that the sprite follows the mouse and left clicking again after entering build mode places the sprite only one a tile instead of resetting the build mode. I started just trying to make it so that the shrine's position will be the same as the mouse position, and it made it so now the mouse doesn't turn the tilesgreen. I took the code that I added for the shrine position out and the tiles still aren't turning green. I am not sure why why this is happening, but I need to figure it out before I move on. We figured out what the problem was so we went to fix it. I helped Aiden with a problem that he had since he was making a scene testing scrolling through the tools that you have. Ian went and fixed what we thought was the problem since it was with his player scene and I tested it once he fixed it, but it didn't fix the tiles only turning green if the player's collision shape is on the tile.
