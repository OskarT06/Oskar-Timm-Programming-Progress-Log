I went back to trying to figure out how to make the bird enemy wander around and play the correct animations when it is walking in specific directions. I found a tutorial that says it will give me code to make an enemy walk up and down along a grid and it should give me working code to accomplish this task. I got the bird to fly up and down though it doesn't play the correct aniamtions yet. It plays only the idle aniamtion which is technically the same as the fly down animation which is correct and it plays that when it moves down, but it doesn't turn around and start playing the fly up animation when it moves up, though it shouldn't be that hard to fix. The most confusing thing is that I followed along with this tutorial before and did everything the same exact way I am doing it now, and it didn't work before but it is working this time. I was able to make the bird play the correct animations when walking up and down.
