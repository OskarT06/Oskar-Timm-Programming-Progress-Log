I went back to just changing some things around in my code to see if I can fix the enemy. I looked in the documentation for Godot to see if they had any suggestions on what steps I should take. I found an entire section for navigation systems, each 2D navigation system talked about ways to make it with nodes that I had never even heard of. I followed along with the steps of what it ssaid to make a navigation polygon, but when I made it and put all of the script in, the sprite only moved to the closest edge of the polygon and then stopped moving. After that, I messed around with the code that I had before, changing some commands and moving commands like the get_next_position command under other functions to see what it did. I was able to make it so that the frog waits two seconds at the position I put it, then it just does what it did before and moves to (0,0) just to continuously print what it's next target is. Hiro added new code to hopefully make it work. It is closer to working but we still have to figure stuff out.
