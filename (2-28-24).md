I went back to trying to think of more game features that we can use. I looked back over the ones I made yesterday to see if I got inspiration for another one, but unfortunately, I've hit a developing block and can't think of any new features to add. Hiro still hasn't said if he wants us to add anything to the godot project, but him and Marshall haven't finished the main, underlying code of the game so we should probably wait until that is done. Marshall has gotten the main code of the game to work, so we might be able to start adding new things to the project. Now that Marshall and Hiro have talked about it a little more, they want to start coding the game in c sharp so we have to install a different verison of godot. It took a little bit of trouble shooting, but I figured out how to install the .net version. When I tried to open the project with the .net version, it told me to install something else from a website to be able to open it. I did install it, but I had to do something else before I could open it. It all works now so I can open the project in .net for the c sharp support.
