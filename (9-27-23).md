I went back to the tutorial I found on how to make an enemy to try and make the bird actually chase the player and try to make it patrol a given area. Zack told me that I don't need to try and code the chasing because Hiro already figured out how to make enemy pathfinding, so he told me to instead work on trying to figure out how to make an enemy randomly wander within a given area. I couldn't get the Marker2D node to work with making the enemy move around in a given area.
