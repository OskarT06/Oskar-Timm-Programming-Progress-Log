Zack told me that since Hiro is making a crafting system menu, he could also make one for the building system and then we could finish up building later. He asked if I did the tool scrolling scene, then asked if I instance the game map scene inot the tool testing scene and told me to put a player in the scene with it to work on the tools and being able to break the world objects that they can break. I added more animations to the animated sprites to that the rock and tree won't just disappear when they are clicked on, they will instead play their harveting animations and the after a 20 minute timer ends, they will respawn. It is telling me that I can't set the index to play on an animated sprite with a value of type string. I am not sure what this means so will have to ask someone else if they know how to solve it or do some research on how to troubleshoot this error. Zack showed me how to fix it and solve another error that came up later. I now just have to make it so that it doesn't play the harvesting animation even after it is harvested and so that it doesn't continuously start and end the timer even when the tree is not clicked on. Once I can figure this out for the tree, it should be very easy to transfer the same thing over to the rock so it won't have the saem problems. I am going to make it so that the box with the tools in it follows the player, but I am most likely going to have to make a ui to do that which I have no experience with so it will probably take a while.
