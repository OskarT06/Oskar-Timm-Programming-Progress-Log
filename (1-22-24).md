I went back to trying to make the shrine placeable. For some reason, when I say that when shift has been pressed the sprite shouldn't get the mouse position, it just says that it is a standalone line and that the expression has no effect. I am not sure how to solve this or why it is saying it is a standalone expression even though it is part of the if statement for when shift is pressed. I downloaded the newest version of godot since Hiro changed his version over to the new one so we all had to in order to prevent conflicts. I started looking through the documentation to see if I could find anything to help with figuring out how to make the sprite stop moving when shift is pressed. I was originally trying to make it so that the sprite just stopped getting the mouse's position when shift is pressed which didn't work, so I am now trying to figure out if there is a way to detect where a key is pressed and make the sprite stop where the key is pressed. So far I haven't made much progress towards my goal, but I have found that you can't look for a key event position because the code can't look for if it is pressed somewhere and just when it is pressed. Aiden needed a little help with his tool testing scene so I switched over to his branch to help him since I know godot a little more.
