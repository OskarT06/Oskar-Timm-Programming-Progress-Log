I was tasked with making an "AI" for the basic shadow enemy to make them wander around. I found a tutorial that said it was showing how to code an enemy to randomly wander around, but the tutorial was mentioning code that was put in a different tutorial so I wasn't able to use it. I found another tutorial, but it was for an older version of godot so it didn't work either. I found someone asking for code to make their enemy walk around and they showed the code that they had already which I used to make the character target the player, but that didn't work either. I was then tasked with animating the enxt enemy for our game since it was finished today.
