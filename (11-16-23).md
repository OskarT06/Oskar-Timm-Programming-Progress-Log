Davian and I will have to work on the song for the other ending to the game, the main game song, and I was asked if I could help Ian and Aiden with setting up the final product of the game. Davian and I worked on the Denial ending music, and were able to finish it, but Davian's subscription to FL Studio ended so we can't save the song. We have to work on coding for the game to get a playable game up and on itch. Now, we can't upon any of the music we made becasue all of the things that we changed yesterday didn't save. We've had to scrap parts of the story to be able to get a working game uploaded onto itch in time. Now that all of the music is no longer working, I am just helping anyone who needs it. We started to try to get the music working with what we have left of the acceptance song as just the main game song.
