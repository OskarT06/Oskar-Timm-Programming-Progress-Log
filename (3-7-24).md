I went back to the C# tutorials that I found yesterday. I am trying to do the next tutorial after the first, but the editor won't load so I can't put any of the code in. The editor still hasn't loaded after letting it sit for an hour and occasionally reloading the page. Nothing I have done has fixed the issue of it not loading and I am not sure what I can do to fix it. I tried closing the page and reopening it but it didn't change anything. Ian was working on the title screen, but couldn't figure out how to make it line up with the viewport properly so I tried and was able to get it to line up, but the words were blurry. Hiro came over and showed us how to change the texture to keep the words from being blurry which I will have to remember for when we go back to our usual project. Aiden was trying to make a pixel art stamp and I helped him just try to make it look like a stamp instead of an atari controller or an arcade cabinet joy stick. Davian was trying to make a cool design in the automaton to put on the itch page but can't figure out how to make a specific design that he wants. I am going to try to help him make a design since the C# tutorial won't load. Marshall made it so that you can change the color of the tiles, so we've been messing around with that and getting new cool designs for the itch page of our game. We made one of each color, and now Marshall is adding a dual color shifting system and making it so that the tiles change color based on their age which we might make some new designs with once he finishes it. I went to Ian's computer and set the title screen to the main scene so it will load the title when running the project and pressing play will load the scene where you can draw your shapes.
