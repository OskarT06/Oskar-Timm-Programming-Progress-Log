Now that we have all of our branches set up, I am going to try and fix my enemies to get them working again. I'm starting by looking through the code to see if something is missing in the code that is preventing it from working. The code is still the same as it was before when it was working, and I realized that they stopped working when I added the shadow enemy to Hiro's scene. I tried taking the enemy out of his sceme to see if that changed anything, but it is still just as broken. I started looking through old files because they were not named correctly and found that when the files were renamed, the sprites dissappeared so I went through all of the old animaitons, remade them, then renamed the files and the corresponding scripts to the correct enemy names. I then changed my frog wander code back to what it was before, and now it doesn't start playing the scene, it just gives me the error invalid get index 'direction' (on base: 'Nil'). I think I have gotten this error on this code before, but I forgot how to fix it. I remembered that I had to assign the wandering direction to the node that I made with the wandering code and that should get rid of the error and hopefully everything should work after that. It didn't work the way it is supposed too, but I at least got something different to happen.
