I continued trying to make it so that when the enemy hits a marker, it will pause for a second before moving to the next point. I was able to make ti so that the enemy can bounce between the markers, but they have a detection radius now which should help with making it so the enemy pauses at the marker before moving to the next one. I found a way to make it so that the enemy will pause at one of the markers when it gets to it, but I still haven't found a way to make it so that the enemy unpauses after a timer timesout. Zack suggested a way that I could do it that I never thought of but would be a lot easier that what I was trying to do. He said that I should just set a timer fo r the enemy that go off to make just the enemy move instead of a timer for each marker.
