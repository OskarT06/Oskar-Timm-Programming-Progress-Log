I looked into the scene I made of a temporary tile map to test the enemy chasing the player, to see if I could find anything in the inspector that would explain why the enemy doesn't chase the player. I started closing the tabs in Godot that I had already finished so I had to go into finder and organize or files a little bit so all of the animations I have done are all in the same file. Zack finished making the frog enemy, so I started working on that.
