I continued trying to make multiple enemies target different sets of markers. Hiro was able to get the multi wander mechanic working so I went through and started reorganizing the scenes I was using. I went back and renamed all the scenes that were called waspmarkers to just enemymarkers with different numbers for different layouts since all of the enemies will have the same patrol patterns. Ian also pulled the changes that Hiro made, so he tried to make the multi wander work for the lion enemy. I then started trying to translate Drunkard"s walk from Python which is proving to be a little difficult because I don't know Python. I had ot declare multiple things written in the Python code as variables to get rid of errors, but know it is giving me and error that gives me another error when fixed, which then gives me the old error if I fix the new one.
