Now that I have put all of the areas and collision shapes back, I can start adding the scripts to them so they change their appearance when they enter each other's areas. I made a script to make it so that the walls automatically play what they look like when they are placed on their own instead of when they are touching and form a house. I copied the mouse following script over to the walls script, but for some reason, it doesn't work saying that it can't get a sprite to follow the mouse even though that is how the building system works. I don't know why it is giving me these errors since it is the same as the code that works for the building system so it should work here, but it just doesn't. I got rid of the building code from the walls script and attached it to the wall sprites themselves instead of the walls grouping node which fixed it. I now just have to figure out how to make it so that the walls will be visible one at a time.
