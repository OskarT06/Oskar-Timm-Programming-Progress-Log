I still don't know what Hiro wants us to work on in the project since only one scene has been made and Hiro is working on it. Hiro said that if we don't know what to do, we can brainstorm game features and figure out how multiplayer is going to work since Hiro and Marshall want to make it so that 2 people can play this game together against each other. I started adding a couple features into a new assignment I made on the Taiga that Aiden set up, but I can't think of any more. I'm just going to back up for a minute and just think to see if I can come up with anymore features that we can put into the game. Davian and I went back to Conway's Game Of Life to see a little more of what our game is based off of. I thought that I might be able to use some of the knowledge of what it looks like to add some more game features, but I think our game will be more different from Conway's than it will be similar.
