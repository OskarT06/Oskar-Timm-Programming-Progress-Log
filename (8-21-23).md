I listened to all of the pitches and considered everyone. All of the designers pitching their ideas seemed like they put a lot of thought and attention into their ideas so I didn't want to completely dismiss any of the ideas until I heard everything the designer had to say. When I chose my group, it was luckily made of most of the poeple that I had gotten to know a little bit about on the Wednesday before so they already knew my name and I already knew their's so we could get straight to coming up with ideas. Once we came up with ideas and chose the main components of the game, I finished the downloads of whatever hadn't finished on the Friday before and began looking for a game engine.
