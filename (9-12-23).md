Hiro told me that he already has working code to make an enemy chase a player sohe is putting the code in for the enemy to chase the player. Once he is done with that, I'm going to try and make it so that the enemy plays aniations when it walks and see if I can get the enemy to attack. Zack finished the snake sprite so I was able to animate it. I've now animated five enemies and Zack is working on the sixth. I went to the THNS meeting to learn what would be happening if I joined. We tried to come up with a permanent name for Deer Skull. I threw out a suggestion; Thanatos, named after the Greek god of death. Zack like the name so we're going with that and Thomas worked on integrating the name into the lore and writing a way to include how the in-game characters came up with the name Thanatos.
