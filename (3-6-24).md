I was helping more yesterday, so I made less progress in the best practices than I would have normally. After the assessment review, I finished the best practices and now have to find something else to do. Hiro suggests that I learn C# so I'll look for things to learn that. I found a codeacademy lesson that teaches C#, but it takes 20 hours to complete so it will take me a few classes to finish it. I started it, but after I finished the super basic stuff, it said that I had to pay or start a free trial to continue. When I chose the free trial option, it said I then had to choose a payment plan for when the free trial ends. I don't have any credit cards linked to my gmail, so I wouldn't have been able to choose a payment plan even to just get it out of the way. Since that method of learning C# required money, and a new version of the project was just pushed, I went through and started looking for bugs. I thought I found a couple, but they were just weird issues that stopped after closing and reopening the play screen. I watched over Hiro's shoulder for a little bit because he was making a build of the game and trying to export it which I don't have any experience with so I was looking to learn a little more about it. When Hiro exported the game and showed Marshall how it runs, he saw that there was an issue with the game. Turns out that the generation number box has overflow enabled which I thought was an issue but didn't know for sure if it was an issue or it was intentional. I found a new tutorial for C# that doesn't require a payment plan. I completed the first introduction tutorial, and found that there are loads of other tutorials that I cna work on at a later date since I think the shortest tutorial takes 48 minutes.
