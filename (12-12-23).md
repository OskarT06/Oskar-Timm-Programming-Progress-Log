I checked to make sure my bear trap was still working as intended and not doing something strange it wasn't doing before like yesterday. Luckily everything is still working how it should. We went to make more sound effects with the new microphone, but the ipad wasn't done charging so we waited for that to finish before making anymore. Ian changed branches to get access to the ranger station scene ot help Aiden with it, and that for some reason, changed the player scene that he has been working on and got functional, to an older version that doesn't work the way it is supposed to. I took a step back to make sure that I didn't accidentally do something that reverses his rogress or messes the scene up more since what I have been working on depends on the player. We made some more sound effects after the i pad got some more charge. There are still some more sound effects that we have to figure out, but we got a considerable amount done today. Ian worked on my computer to fix the problem with the wrong version of the player scene being loaded instead of the correct version. He had to redo the animations and then it was fixed.
