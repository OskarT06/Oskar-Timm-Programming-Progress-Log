I checked again, and found that for some reason, the left corner walls and the side wall line up but none of the other walls do. I don't know that the difference is between the right side and the left side keeping it from lining up or the normal wall and door being prevented form lining up with the left side walls. Before I try anf giure that out, I am going to finish off making the collision shapes for the other walls. I finished all of the collision shapes so the next thing I have to figure out is either making them snap correctly, or making it so that a normal wall and a side wall become a corner wall. I asked Zack if he had any idea on how to change the walls and making them snap properly. He came over and added a couple other variables and added some things to the funcitons changing where the walls snapped.
