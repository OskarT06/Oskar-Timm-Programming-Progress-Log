We started by trying to solve more problems with our game. We had a meeting discussing what we needed to do for our game to be able to get it done by friday. Davian and I figured out how to solve the problem with the music not saving, but we can't fix the problem now. The new engine that we are using can't use specfic audio files so I started looking for audio file converters. We found a place where we can export the files as mp3 files which is what we think is the main audio file import set-up for Ren'Py. Davian and I asked Ian and Aiden if they could look to see what audio files Ren'Py supports just to be sure, and luckily, mp3 files are one of the 3 types of supported files.
