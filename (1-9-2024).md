I went back to the building test scene I started yesterday to start writing code so that the sprite will appear and follow the mouse after pressing the middle mouse buttong until I have a better idea of the controls for the building system. I have been able to make it so that the sprite will appear when pressing the middle mouse button, but I can't get it to follow the mouse. I have been able to make it appear and disappear, but I ran into a problem where pressing any key makes the sprite disappear instead of just pressing the f key like I set it in the code. I asked Zack for a little more information on what he wants the temporary controls for the building to be and Zack said that he wants left click to be choosing and placing, and right click to be canceling. That was a very easy change to my code which fixed the problem with multiple keys all making the shrine appear since I changed the method from looking just for an input event to just look for the specific actions saved in our input map menu.
