I am going to try to make it so that when you press one of the buttons in the housetest scene, it will change what wall you are putting down. I was able to make it so that the button makes a normal wall appear, but it would make it appear at the same time as the side wall. I showed Zack and he suggested that I make it so that the side wall also only appear when you click on a button. I made a button for each wall, got rid of some of the code and moved it to a different section, and now every button and wall is working. I now just have to try to figure out why the normal walls and corner walls are not lining up properly. Zack showed me how to add different collision shapes for different walls so each wall can have a different collision shape. I tested it, and for some reason, the side wall and left corners line up, but nothing else does. I started making new collision shape resources, but found at that having them saved as resources wouldn't have worked for all of the walls. Zack said to just make the collision shapes in seperate scenes so I now have a collision shape for the normal wall, the top right corner, and the bottom left corner. The side walls shouldn't be too hard ot make, but the other corners will be a little tough.
