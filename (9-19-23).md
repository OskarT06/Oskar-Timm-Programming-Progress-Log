I went back to try and fix the enemy chasing the playe. None of the code was working and the enemy wasn't playing animations. Thomas sent me the link to another video covering how to make an enemy so I am going to try that. The link that Thomas sent was showing how to make it work with an AnimatedSprite2D, and the code wouldn't work. The code was supposed to make the enemy walk up and down on a grid by 3 spaces at a time and it  wouldn't work at all. I found another tutorial that said it was going to explain how to make a wandering enemy in 2 minutes so I followed along with that and everything was working perfectly fine and there weren't any errors in the code until the very end when I hit the play button to test it. It would instantly close the play screen and give me an error that didn't make sense. I haven't been able to find anyhting giving me something that I can use to fix the error.
