I found a new error with the bear trap that wasn't happening on Friday. For some reason, when the enemy is trapped and is playing the attacking animation, if the player leaves the enemy's area and then re-enters it, the enemy stops playing the animation and doesn't do anything else. I was finally able to make it so that the bear trap can be "broken" by the enemy, however, the enemy still doesn't just coninuously attack down. This animation problem shouldn't be too hard to fix though. All I had to do to fix this problem, I had to go back to the enemy's script and comment out the lines that make it play the attack animation when the player enters a certain area2D and that fixec it. Zack looked and made it so that the bear trap isn't destroyed, and the enemy can just get out of the bear trap and the player can go back and reset it. I started trying to put in sound effects for the bear trap. Davian found a video tutorial to figure out how to do it, so he knows a little bit more than I do. Once either me or Davian can figure out how to add sound effects to the game, we'll be able to add all of the sound effects very easily.
