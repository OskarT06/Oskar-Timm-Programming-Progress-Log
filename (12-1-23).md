Since Davian and I finished the rest of the songs that we needed for the game, I am going to help where I am needed unless the designers want us to make more. Aiden has been figuring out what he needs to on his own, so I am just sitting behind him learning Ren'Py as he does. So far the designers haven't told us that we need to make anymore songs, and I can't try programming because only one person can work on the script at a time and Aiden and Ian are making some good progress so I don't want to get in their way. I headed down to the VR Lab to see how the voice acting was going and from what I heard, everything was going fairly well. Davian and I were tasked by Adien to research something that he is trying to do and can't figure out while he got the rest of the dialogue in the game. He was trying to show an image of Lady Luck after a dialogue box so Davian and I looked for solutions to the problem, I found a website that should work and found that we had to mak layers and write in the code to display the image on the specific layer. I sent the link of the website to Aiden through discord so we just have to wait until he can finish the dialogue to see if it works.
