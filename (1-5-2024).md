I have to continue converting the rest of the audio files, figure out why the audio files are not showing up in the godot editor, as well as fixing my bear trap and trying to think of a way that I could make my own building system that actually works. I was able to get all of the audio files converted into mp3 files, so now I am going to try to get the bear trap working again. Ian suggested something that I tried which actually worked. He said that I should take the enemy's speed after the trap is "broken" and multiply it by something so it doesn't move so slow. I just have to figure out the perfect number to multiply the speed by so that the enemy moves at its normal speed. I found the number to multiply the speed by so it stays at the same speed and doesn't just randomly start moving extremely slowly. I now have to figure out some system to make it so the bear trap can detect how many times it has been set off and broken out of so I can show the broken version the trap and the trap can no longer stop the enemy until it is repaired.
