I am not sure what to do next, so I will just ask if there is anything that the designers need me to do. There isn't really I anything that I need to do so I am just going to help where I am needed. I helped Ian and Aiden with coding problems that they had, such as flipping the tower tarot card sprite without having to make an entire new sprite and being able to click anywhere and the dialog will continue doing the same thing as when you would press enter. I then helped Davian with moving over a song to a new project so we could put it into a lower key to make it sound spookier, but once we finished it, we realized that it just sounded weird in a lower key so we just left the original alone and kept it to the side in case it fit a different song. Conner told us to look at the taiga so we can see where the writers wrote the dialogue for the endings and asked if we could start making music for the endings. Davian and I started brainstorming what we wanted the endings to sound like and the original song that we saved was luckily a very good fit for the acceptance ending so we went back to it and started adjusting and fine-tuning the song to make it sound more mellow and tranquil. We then asked Beckham what he thought after we added something and he pointed us in a direction that gave us an idea of what to do. We had drums in the backround that made the song sound really energetic which wasn't really what we wanted, and he gave us the idea to make the drums start out quiet, then fade in, and then be at full volume half way through the song. We did this and then I suggested that we separate where the drums go from quiet to full volume and make it so that the entire song stops for a couple of seconds before starting again with the drums. Davian and I figured out how to make the song blend together very well, so we now just have to make a denial song that sounds like the complete opposite of the acceptance song.
