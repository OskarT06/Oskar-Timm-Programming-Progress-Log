I continued trying to make the enemy pause at a marker before getting up and moving again. I started by deleting all of the timers except one because that was the only one that I needed for the enemy. I was able to make it so that the enemy stops at a marker, but it wouldn't start moving again. I can either make it stop at the marker, or make the enemy bounce between the markers, I can't do them at the same time. Hiro helpedme with the code and was able to make it so that it does stop at a point before moving again.
