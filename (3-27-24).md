I asked Zack what he wanted me to do with the building system, and he said to pull from his branch because he made a few changes to the collision shapes. When I did however, new errors came up that I didn't know what they were or why they were coming up because Zack said that it should have worked. Zack and Hiro took a look at it and said the best choice for me was to just wait until Hiro finishes with the player and pull his changes so everything is up to date. I pulled from Zack's branch a couple more times to get fully up to date and to have all of the progress of the game so I could play it. I went though and found a couple bugs that I let Zack know about when he was available. I have now been able to pull from Hiro's branch and can continue working on the building scene a check to see if there are any other bugs in the main scene that I can quickly find. The bugs that I found in the main scene were the same as before I pulled so I didn't bother with telling anyone the same bugs I already did. However, since I have the newest version of the tools, you only have the tools when you craft them so I can't get the hammer to build anything in my house test scene.
