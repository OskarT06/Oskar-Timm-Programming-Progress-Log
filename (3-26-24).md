Zack took a look at the building system to see if he could fix the issues that we found yesterday. For some reason, before placing a wall the first time, it has to be moved in order to placed. We also found that you can be placing 2 walls at the same time and that when you try to place a red wall, it brings the building menu back up which Zack does not want to happen. He found what he thinks the problem is, but we have to add code to the player which Hiro is working on at the minute so we have to either get him to add the code or wait until he is done with it and add it ourselves. A couple of the walls don't line up with others so I went through and fixed them, the only thing hindering them being the collision shapes overlap by one pixel. Hiro and Zack were both very busy, so I couldn't ask them what they want me to do with the building system to fix the problems.
