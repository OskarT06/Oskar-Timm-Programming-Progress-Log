Now that all of the enemies are done, I am not entirely sure what to work on next so I just started fine tuning the enemies. Zack told me that a couple of the enemies that I made to pause are not supposed to pause so I went back and changed them. I tried instancing the bat enemy with all of the wander into our main scene to test if it works, but I found out that the markers are just moving with the nemy for some reason so it is picking a place to move to but it can technically make it to the marker because they are moving in the same direction as the enemy instead of being stationary. I cama up with a solution to this problem, where we make the wnader scenes just the enemy with the code and the markers are added to the instanced scene as a separate thing so they don't move with the enemy. The only downside is that Ian and I would have to show everyone else how to set up the markers properly, which shouldn't be that hard, maybe just a little to tough to explain in a simple way that everyone can remember. I went through and renamed the group names for the markers since every enemy has its own code I am able to change the code and group names for the other enemies and it won't affect any of the other enemies.
