I found a small problem with my bear trap that I have to figure out how to fix. I found that even if the bear trap is triggered, it will still make the enemy stop moving and start attacking the bear trap like it is trapped in it, but it shouldn't be able to because the bear trap hasn't been reset yet. I figured out how to add the bear trap triggering audio that we made, but I have to figure out how to make adjust when the sound starts because there is a small gap between when the sound plays and when it starts in the mp3 file so there is a small pause between when the trap is triggered and when the trigger sound plays. Zack now wants me to work on the building system since it is more important than the traps at the moment. I started wrking on the building system a little bit, but stoped because I am not sure where to go from where I am.
