I kept helping Aiden with his tool test scene. I have to make it so that the tools cancel each other out when one it visible and then another is made visible by pressing its corresponding number. I also have to make it so that the tools will only work on the things that they are made for, such as a pickaxe on a rock or an axe on a tree. I made it so that every tool can cancel another out. I was also able to make it so that the tree is only broken if the axe is selected. I am next going to make it so that the rock can only be broken if the pickaxe is selected. There are a few other things that I can do for the other tools like the knife, next, and hammer. I finished making the rock work, and Zack wants me to work on the building system some more so I ahve to go back ot trying ot figure out how to make it so that the when I press shift, the sprite stops getting the mouse's position.
