I am going back to adjusting the snap offset and interval to make all of the walls line up properly. I was able to make the normal wall line up with the door wall, but for some reason it only lines up on the right side of the door. I remembered something that I found I had to fix that I should probably do before making them line up. I have to make it so that if the wall hasn't been placed yet, you can't walk into the wall so the collision shape won't stop you since it teechnically doesn't exist yet. Zack cmae and looked at it and changed a couple things such as how the z index works and the collision shapes not being instantiated until the wall is placed. Zack had me merge from his branch so I could get a working version of one of the scenes, and it got rid of all of the newest code that I put in that all worked. Neither me or Zack now how to fix it, and if we can't fix it, I am going to have to re-write all of my working code. Hiro came over and I told him what was wrong and he even said that what happened shouldn't have happened.
