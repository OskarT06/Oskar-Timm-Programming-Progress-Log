I continued reading the best practices for godot. Ian was trying to figure out how to make it so that an arrow will change what it looks like depending on whther the ui options menu is expanded or collapsed. I thought that I would be able to help and made a little bit of progress, but once I got the arrow to flip when closing the menu, I couldn't get it to flip back. Marshall was changing things with the ui script and was able to make the arrow flipping fully functional so we don't have to worry about it anymore.
