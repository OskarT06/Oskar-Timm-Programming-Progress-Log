I found a new tutorial that also provided me with assets and guided me through the steps of using them to make a game. This game was another simple top down 2D so I figured that this tutorial would help more than the other because this was the kind of game that we were making. This tutorial taught me more things that the other did such as how to adjust the camera to make it closer to the character and what character sprites are used for. This totorial was much less in depth than the previous Dodge The Creeps one I found, but it showed more features of godot.
