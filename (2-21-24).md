I don't know how close to being finished with the building system UI is, but I still have to wait until he is done so we don't have conflicted changes since we would be working on the same scene in the same branch. I watched what Hiro was doing so I would have a better understanding of how to building menu works in case I have a problem with it or I need to use similar code again. I listened through all of the songs that Davian has made and checked to see if I thought of anything he could change. I found one that I thought was actually pretty promising which I told Davian and he said that it is a work in progress. Hiro finished the building menu, so I now need to fine tune the collision shapes a little more, change the door so you can walk through it, and make it so that walls can't be placed on top of each other. I pulled from base building and went to open my house test scene, and found that when one of walls is placed, it crashes because it couldn't instantiate a collision shape for it. I told Hiro that there wouldn't be a difference between the top wall and bottom wall, so he said to go back through certain scripts and change the enumerators to only say wall instead of top wall and delete everything that said bottom wall. He also told me to add the new building menu to the player nodes scene to be with the rest of the ui and that I would have to add a new node 2d and call it base part handler to export it into the building menu to make it functional. I changed the side wall collision so it is the entire wall instead of just half of it, so I know just have to make it so they can't overlap.
