Most of our team isn't here today, and I don't know if Zack has finished what he was working on in the building scene so I might just follow along with some more C# tutorials until Zack is back on the project. After our team meeting, Zack told me that he wants me to finish up the building system and that he already has some code that I can use to add collision detecting and color shifting. Zack didn't fully finish the base part offset so 2 of the walls don't line up properly. He told me to wait to change anything until he is done making all of the walls line up properly. Once Zack and Aiden finished collarborating to finish the walls, he showed me what code I would have to write to make the walls and areas to work.
