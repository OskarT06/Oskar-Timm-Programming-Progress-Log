I continued trying to translate the drunkard's walk from python into GD script. I am not sure if I will be able to completely translate it and make it fully functional because it is telling me to import a file that doesn't exist, and I don't know what the file is supposed to be becuase the name of the file on the code challenge is just a bunch of random numbers and letters. I started setting up multi wander scenes for the other enemies to test if they all work. It took a little bit of adjusting from the wasp code, but I was able to get the bat wandering properly and having multiple enemies targeting different sets of points. Once I finished the bat wandering, I went to the scene that Ian made with all the other enemies wandering and started putting the wasps and bats into the scene to see all of the enemeies working at once. I then remembered that we forgot to make the wandering for the Shadow enemy, so I made that and then put it into the multi enemy wander scene with all of the other wandering enemies. S smalll problem happened where me and Ian both accidentally edited the same scene so it made it so neither of us could open the scene. He has to work on the attack animations for the player, so I started going through and remaking everything that was deleted by me reverting our changes so we could open the scene. I had to redo the vulture wander, and then insert that into the multi enemy wander scene. I had to go though and adjust the size for the goat becuase it was on a different scale than all of the other enemies. Luckily, all I had ot do was just fix the scale on the animated sprite for the goat and everything went back to normal.
