Now that the wandering is finished, I am not entirely sure what to work on next. Zack came up to me and told me that he wants me to make a building system starting with the protection shrine which is just placed one time and then can be used. I found a tutorial that is showing how to make a placing system and how to make it so that it has borders so you can't just place it anywhere. The turoial I found however, uses a plugin that contains all the script for the scene but you have to pay for the plugin that he uses and he doesn't show the code for the plugin so I can't make it myself.
