I went back to my base building scene and found that there were quite a few dependencies that I had to fix. A couple of them, I had to ask Zack what I had to fix and he said I had to start going farther down the file path into the scenes that have a problem with the dependencies. Hiro then came over and I started showing him what certain things did in the base building script because he said he was going to make the ui for the building system. I pushed my changes, and now I have to wait until Hiro is finished with the ui to continue working with the building system. I have had to tell Hiro what a couple of things do in the codes that I used to make the building scene. He also showed me a few things that I could have done differently that would have been easier than what I did which I am going to try and remember for the future.
