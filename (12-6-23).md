I went through and started renaming scenes so that they are all the same style and renamed nodes in those scenes to be able to tell what node is what easier. I then started to try to make the bear trap work and actually keep the enemy from moving when it is triggered. I gt it so that it plays the triggering animation, and then plays that last frame of the animation of it just closed, then when the area is exited, it temporarily plays the resetting animation, but it doesn't play the triggering animaiton again. The trap is also only triggered by the player and not the enemy. Davian wants to make some custom sounds for the game, so after break, Divain, Aiden, and I are going to start working on making custom sounds for the game such as swinging, walking, hitting a rock with a pickaxe, hitting a tree with an axe, and whatever other sounds we would need. We came back and asked Zack for what sounds we should make next, and we recruited Ian for making dying a whispering sounds. I made a discord channel and started listing off the other sound effects we have to make that I could just think of off of the top of my head for us to make tomorrow.
