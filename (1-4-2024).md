I went back to check if my bear trap still works, and luckily it is still working. Zack said that we really need to get the base building and just building system in general up and running and asked if I could start working on it. I started my just making a new scene and looking at all of the nodes to see how I could make a building system myself since all of the tutorials I have found in the past require a 30 dollar plugin to work. Zack suggested I change some things such as incorporate a new sprite frame that looks damaged. We also have to convert all of the sound effect files from aac to mp3. I converted about 7 files, but for some reason, they don't show them in the music file even though that is where I put them in the finder. I will have to figure that out, convert the rest of the files, figure out how to incorporate the sound effects, and figure out how to make it so that the bear trap will show a specific sprite frame after being triggered a certain amount of times and doesn't get triggerd or stop the enemy if it is showing the broken frame. I pulled from enemies after Ian pushed his sound effects and now the enemy is having problems. The enemy started out just walking straight up, then I put in a navigation layer and now when the enemy sets off the bear trap and the timer runs out so it should be able to move again, the enemy starts moving incredibly slow.
