I am still tring to figure out how to make it so that we can place a shrine. I've been trying to make it so that when a button is pressed, the shrine no longer looks for the mouse's position so it won't be able to move, but so far it hasn't worked. I made it so that if Shift was pressed, it should print that it was pressed, which showed me that it isn't even detecting that shift has been pressed. I went to the godot documentation to see if I was arranging the statement incorrectly, but what I found in the documentation wasn't very helpful. I found a different statement that still wouldn't detect that shift was pressed and would just print that shift was pressed when the left mouse button was pressed. I found a different function that made it so it would detect when shift was pressed, printed that shift was pressed when it actually was, and didn't print when the mouse was pressed. I now just have to figure out how to make it so that the sprite stops following the mouse and stays where it is when shift is pressed. I started trying different things that I can think of to make it so that the shrine stops moving and stays where it is when shift is clicked. Davian then came down and asked if I could help them make a scream that sounds like it is echoing.
