I went back to trying to fix my issue with the sprites not following the mouse properly. I tried changing the viewport back to what it was originally since that was what I pulled before everything stopped working. Unofrtuneately, it didn't work, so I am not entirely sure where to go from here. I tried going back to find the original video that I used to make the sprites follow the mouse to see if it would help to re-write it, but I can't find it. I was able to find a way to work around it with the assistance of Royce that should work better than what I was doing.
