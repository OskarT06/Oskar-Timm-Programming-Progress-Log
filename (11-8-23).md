I started following along with the tutorial for placing that Zack sent me. I had to get Aiden to make me a new temporary tile map so I can make the placing system which took a little bit so I helped out Davian with music things and trying to figure out why it deleted all of his progress from Friday. Once Aiden finished the tile map, I started following along with the tutorial and luckily nothing has gone wrong. I got to the code part and I did have to change it a little bit because the tutorial didn't have @ symbols infront of the export and onready variables which isn't really a major problem and an incredbily easy fix. I then helped Aiden with something else, he was trying to make it so that the player walks behind the protection shrine, so I showed him how to put the shrine on a Z index above the player so that the shrine can still detect the player, but the player is always behind it when they overlap. I got to the end of part one, so I will have to start working on part two to finish off the tutorial. At the end of part one, it gives code that hasasset preload things in a set of parenthesis, but godot isn't allowing the asset names to be in the parenthesis because it says that it expected end of statment and found identifier instead. I am not sure how to fix this error, so I will have to try to figure it out or ask if anyone has experience with it. Other than that however, there are no errors thankfully.
