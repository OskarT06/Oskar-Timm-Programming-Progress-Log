I went to the project and opened the main scene and found a small problem with it. Instead of it running like an automaton when you draw your shape and then hit the space bar, the pixels just spread out from where you drew them until the entire grid is white. I'll have to tell Hiro or Marshall to see if there is something wrong with the scene or I am just opening the wrong version of the project. Hiro said that what I thought was wrong with the scene with the tiles just spreading until everything is white was only happening because Marshall changes the rules and that what I was seeing was what was supposed to be happening and there wasn't anything wrong with it. I still don't really have anything to do so I'll just help where I can or read over the best practices for godot. I stopped reading the documentation for a little bit so I could fill out the assessment form. It took me a little while to take the assessment because the computer was automaatically logging me into my personal email instead of my school email. I had to scan the qr code and take it on my phone since my phone had both my personal and school emails.
