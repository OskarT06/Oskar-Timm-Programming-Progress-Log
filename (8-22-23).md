Since we found a game engine on pitch day, all of the programmers set out to start learning our game engine. I found a tutorial for a game called Dodge The Creeps which provided me assets to make this game, and showed me how to make a simple 2D game. This tutorial showed me how to do basic things that I know will come in handy later down the line such as adding parent nodes and child nodes, linking all of them together, adjusitng window sizes, mapping inputs, creating characters models, and giving characters and enemies hitboxes that fit their models. I followed this tutorial until the end of class and learned a few mechanics of Godot that will help later down the line when we start working on our game.
