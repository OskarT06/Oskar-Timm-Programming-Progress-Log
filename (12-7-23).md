We went back to making more sound effects, checking the ones off of the list that I made yesterday. Before everyone else arrives, I am going to try to get the bear trap working. I was able to make it so that the trap can now be set off by the enemy, but the player can still set it off. I will figure that out later, for now I am going to try to make it so that the trap doesn't just continuously play the triggering animation and only is able to play that animation again when it is interacted with and reset. I made it so that the already set interaction button can reset the bear trap and that the bear trap can only play the springing animation if the animation before it is the reayd animation, if it is not the ready animation, it will not play the springing animation. I went back to the docs to find the exact function I had to put in to make it so that right clicking will reset the bear trap. Zack then tried to see if there was something he could do to make the bear trap only detect a specific layer, but he couldn't figure it out. I went in and set the bear trap to layer 1 and its mask to 16, then went to the collision shape on the shaodw enemy's feet and did the opposite, setting the layer to 16 and the mask to 1. This amde it so that the trap is only set off by the enemy, and can't be set off again until it is reset. Ian was able to help me with making it so that the trap will actually play the animations again instead of just playing them once, and then skipping to the last frame of the animation if the area is entered again. Now the only thing I would have to figure out would be making the enemy stop moving when it triggers the bear trap and how it damages the enemy, but we would have to figure out the normal enemy damaging first. Now that everyone is here, we can continue doing the sound effects. We made a couple more sound effects that we were able to figure out how to make, but there are still quite a few more that we have to figure out how to make. I figured out how to make it so that the enemy can't move when it springs the bear trap. I just put $"../Type1Enemy".speed = 0 under where it triggers the trap, and then $"../Type1Enemy".speed = 60 when the trap is reset. Zack wants the enemy to continue attacking when it is trapped in the bear trap like it trying to break out, and ignore the player, so I have to figure out how to add script referencing child nodes of an instanced scene root.
