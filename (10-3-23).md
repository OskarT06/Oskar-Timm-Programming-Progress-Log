I went back to the projet that I started yesterday. When I opened it, nothing was there though luckily, all I had to do was remake the sprite node and reload the code. I then tested it on the touch screen table. It took a while, but eventually it just worked without me having to changed anything and it works really well. I found a couple of kinks I need to work out such as it moving too slow, and it moves to the most recent point instead of finishing the path that it is currently on. I actually figured out the problem of it moving too slow and skipping points. All I had to do was change the speed of the temporary icon to the same as the max tracking distance.
