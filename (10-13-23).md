I started going back through my code and cleaning up the code that I didn't need. Now, it gives me a debugger error and I don't know why or how ot fix it. I began trying to figure out how to rename the position part of the code to see if that fixed it. Nothing was fixing it until Hiro came over and took a look at it. He was able to change it so that the code no longer came up and the shadow enemy patrolling works. The only problems are that the enemy is very small, very fast, and doesn't pause at the markers. Zack finished making the sprite sheets for the bear and lion enemy so I animated them and ajdusted their speeds according to what Zack wanted.
