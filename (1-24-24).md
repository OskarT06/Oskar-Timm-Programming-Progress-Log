Now that I got the tool test scene working, I moved back to the building system. Ian was trying to make it so that the footsteps and swinging audio works, but couldn't find the swinging audio file. Davian, Aiden, and I started looking through the files for the swinging sound because we can't remember what device we made it on and what device we exported it to. We couldn't find the file anywhere, and realized that the sound effects such as the bear trap, start a little bit after they are triggered, making the bear trap triggering sound after the bear trap has already been set off instead of when it is set off. Zack asked if I could continue working on the building system instead of the audio files, but I still can't figure out how to make it so that the shrine stops getting the mouse's position when shift is pressed. I tried doing the short hand for do not which is !=, but the shrine still follows the mouse. I'm going to have to keep looking to see if there is osme stange way to solve the problem.
