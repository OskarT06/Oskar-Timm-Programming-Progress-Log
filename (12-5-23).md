Since we are working in a newer version of godot now, I started looking to see if I could find anything that someone made on how to code a building system. I started looking in the docs for more information on how I would make a building system and found something talking about different mouse input event buttons so I made a new script to test them and now have a better understanding of how they work. Hiro and I started talking about where we would start to make a building system in our game, and he suggested that I just make it myself instead of looking for tutorials and do what he did to make the inventory and just slowly implement each feature one by one after I can get them working. Reall the first and major thing that I would have to worry about is making a grid system that is green when you can place something, and red when you can not if there is another objects collision shape in the grid. After I get that working, everything else should be fairly easy to get working. I started going through the docs to see if there was anything saying more about how to make a grid.
