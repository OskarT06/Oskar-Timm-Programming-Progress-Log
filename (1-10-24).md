I went back to trying to figure out how to make the sprite of the shrine follow the mouse. Once I get that working, I can make it so that the tiles will change colors if they detect a collision shape. I then have to figure out some way to make it so that what is being placed will snap to the tiles and just able to be placed freely. I am trying to figure out how to make it so that I can change the sprite color in the code and not just the inspector. I figure out with the assistance of hero how to modulate a sprite in the code instead of the editor. I was able to make it so that when left clicking, the shring that I am going to be placing appears and disappears on right click as well as the building tiles so the tiles will appear and disappear at the same time as the shrine I want to place. I merged a different branch into the base building branch to get a fixed version of the player and it deleted everything that I did because the merging branch had an older version of my scene that didn't have any of the new stuff I did so I have to redo all of it. I also thought of a way I could make it so that the tiles turm greem whem the placing shrine is over them, but red if something is over them that something can't be placed on top of. I was able to make it so that the tiles turn green when the player walks over them, so I know need to make it so that the placing shrine follows the mouse, it snaps to the tiles, can't be placed on a tile that something is already placed on, and so the player can't continue moving around when entering build mode. I showed Zack and he said that he wants the player to be able to move aorund while in building mode so that just takes something off that I have to figure out and add. Zack did say though that he wants it to be that the thing you are trying to build will be red or green and not tiles on the ground showing the possibilities and he wants the sprite to be green when you can place it and red when you cant instead of having it snap to a grid. Having is just be green and then turn red when you can't place it shouldn't be too hard, I'll just need an Area2D and have it detect other collision shapes and turn red if it is inside the collision shape of something else such as a wall, tree, rock, or the player.
