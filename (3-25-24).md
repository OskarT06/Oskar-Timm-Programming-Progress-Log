I can't exactly remember what I was working on the last time we had class, so I went back to the bulding system and just started looking to see what I could add, change, or fix with it. I found that the walls line up with the tile map improperly so I will have to fix that, the door only turns red if it detects a collision shape on the right side of the door otherwise it is green and placeable, and it crashes when trying to place something because it can't find a node relative the root node of a different scene that I am running. It turns out that the code that was crashing the scene Zack didn't even want to be there and I didn't remember adding it so I don't know why it was there. After that, all of the walls were becoming doors when you pressed on their buttons. This issue was an easy fix because the problem was that the animation in the base_part scene was selected the door closed animation so it is was just constantly playing that animation instead of changing the animation frame when different walls were selected. Zack and I then found that when you try to place a wall that if red, then select another wall, they overlap because it doesn't get rid of the previous wall allowing them to be placed on top of each other. The areas detecting the other collisions and turning the walls red are off a little bit and overlapping just a tiny bit in some situations, making it so that walls can't be lined up properly. I found out what is wrong with the door and why it only turns red on one side. When the collision for the door was made, it had to be made in three parts so that we could disable the collision on the actual door when it is open so you can walk through it. The collision detection area however, is choosing one of the three door collisions and making the one is chooses the collision shape for the area. The simplest fix for this would probably be to make new collision shapes that cover the entire wall, instantiating the new collision when the wall is not placed yet, then getting rid of it and using the usual collision shapes when it is placed. Zack siad that the ways it was before was okay and that he just wanted the collision shape for the wall to be the area detector shape for the door. I have found now that since I pulled from Zack's branch so our changes were up to date, the wall can still be placed even if it is red and will just remain red and clear. This shouldn't be too hard of a fix since I can just say that you can't place it at all if it is red. All it took to fix the issue was a new can_place variable that was set to false when the color was red and true when the color was green. I then went to the code where it said to set the color to the normal wall color and made it so that it can only happen if can_place is true. I found a weird bug where when you try to place either a wall or a side wall for the first time, they just won't place whether they are green or red. I looked back over the if statements controlling placing, and there wasn't anything that I saw that should make it so that only the wall and side wall can't be placed the first time. I do have to change 3 of the corner collision shapes so that they line up with the other wall properly.
