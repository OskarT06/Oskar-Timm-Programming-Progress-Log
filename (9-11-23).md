Davian's scene with his tests for all the in game music broke so we started the day with trying to fix that. Once I tried to help fix it and what I said to try didn't work, I went back to trying to figure out how to fix the issue with the shadow enemy not targeting the player. I am not sure why it won't work because the player and the enemy are on the same layer so they should be able to interact with each other, and the player can coolide with the enemy hit-box, but the enemy's detection radius just doesn't detect the player when they enter the vacinity. I did have to stop working on the enemy chasing the player for a little whilte because Hiro needed to work on his own scene with the player and we can't work on the same thing in multiple different scenes. Davian, Thomas, and I then started discussing what we want the final boss fight music to sound like.
