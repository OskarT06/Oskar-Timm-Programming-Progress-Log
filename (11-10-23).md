I went back to my scenes for the tests of the building/placing system as well as going over the tutorial just in case I missed anything that is what is causing my test scenes not to work the way the tutorial says. I tried going to the free domain website that it linked in the tutorial and downloading the assets that it uses to see if that helps with making the game the exact same instead of using my own assets. Unfortuneately, it doesn't say what the asset pack is called, so I have to look through the entire website to see if I can find something that looks similar. I was able to find the assets, so I now just have to put them into the file system so I can put them into my test scenes. Even with all the same assets and the exact same code, the tutorial still doesn't work. I noticed that it is written in 3.5, which is most likely the cause of why it isn't working. Once I found this out, I went back to my original task of making the enemy attack animations work when the player enters their detection range. With my past experience with animtions, I was able to easily make it so that the animation plays when the player enters the enemies specific detection area, and the area only detects the player and not other enemies or objects. I then tried to make it so that the correct walking animations would play when the shadow enemy is chasing the player, but all I could get the enemy to do was face the player which didn't really help, and it still only just slid along the ground instead of playing the walking animations.
