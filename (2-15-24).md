Hiro is still reanming the files and organizing, so we still have to wait for him to finish before we can add new things to the project. I've just been witing to see if he needs any help with trying to figure out what a file is for or what files are needed for certain things, but Zack has been helping him so I haven't really needed to help him yet. Zack and Hiro have been running into some problems, so it has been taking them longer to organize the project. Hiro finished, so we all just pulled, but there can still be errors so I'm waiting until we know for sure that we can start adding things to the project before I add anything.
